I am known to do things the **HARD** way when there is ways to do it easier. So, here I am trying to create a blog post on github instead of Jekyll. I am still trying to work out the logistics and am turning in my lab on time by doing it on here. 

I am 20 years old and my birthday is May 23.

    -My younger sister and I have the same birthday, exactly 6 years a part.
